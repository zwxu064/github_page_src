<p class="alignlefttab">Zhiwei used to draw cartoons when he was 12-14 years old in the middle school.
  This hobby taught and accompanied him through his childhood.
  He always drew for quite a lot of hours continuously.
  But he ceased drawing since the high school due to the overloaded study.
  Over 50 paintings out of hundreds were selected as an album to remember his childhood.</p>
