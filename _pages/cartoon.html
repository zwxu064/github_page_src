<p class="alignlefttab">I used to draw cartoons when I was 12-14 years old, in middle school. This after-school hobby taught me and accompanied me quite a lot. I always drew without eating and drinking for quite a lot of hours, that was why my neighbors always complained I ate left-over. Since the high school study was always overloaded, I have not drawn since then. Over 50 paintings out of hundreds were selected and packages as a childhood album to remember that time. It is now covered with a silk cloth and stored in my nightstand at home in China.</p>
