<p class="alignlefttab">I always love little animals. They are naughty and trustful. Accompanied by quite a lot of pets, not at the same time, when I was young, I always felt happy and love. Tropical fishes were my latest pets, after I lost my dog since she passed away after staying at my home for over 12 years. It was quite exciting to see there were more and more baby tropical fishes every a couple of months.</p>
