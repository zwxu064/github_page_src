<p class="alignlefttab">Zhiwei always loves little animals.
   This was an avoidable part of his life in the past, with happyness and love.
   Tropical fishes were his latest pets, after he lost his dog since she passed away after staying at his home for over 12 years.
   Quite exciting to see new baby tropical fishes every few months.</p>
